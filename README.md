Odin-Recipes 

A foundational HTML assignment of The Odin Project featuring various recipes to showcase application of learned fundamentals.   

The website consists of main index with links to a few other recipes. 

I was able to gain a better understanding of how to structure and complete a HTML boilerplate, identify opening and closing tags, identify html elements, how to use certain tags to create certain effects on text, create both ordered and unordered list, understand the difference between absolute and relative paths, and utilize the image and links tag with appropriate attributes for better user interaction.
