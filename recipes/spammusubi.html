        <h2>Spam Musubi</h2>
            <p>Spam musubi is a sushi-like sandwich that is popular in Hawaii.  It has become a family favorite in our household as is very versatile, flavorful, and most importantly quick and easy to make!</p>
            <p>There are many variations to making spam musubi such as adding eggs, including vegetables, seasoning the rice, and seasoning and even cooking the spam differently. Spam musubi usually takes the shape of the spam. 
            There are special molds made specifically for spam musubi, but we like to free-style ours. 
            If you are in a pinch, you can use the spam can as a mold, just be sure to rinse it and line it with cling wrap so you can remove your sandwich from the mold.</p>
