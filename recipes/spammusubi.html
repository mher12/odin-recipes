        <h2>Spam Musubi</h2>
            <p>Spam musubi is a sushi-like sandwich that is popular in Hawaii.  It has become a family favorite in our household as is very versatile, flavorful, and most importantly quick and easy to make!</p>
            <p>There are many variations to making spam musubi such as adding eggs, including vegetables, seasoning the rice, and seasoning and even cooking the spam differently. Spam musubi usually takes the shape of the spam. 
            There are special molds made specifically for spam musubi, but we like to free-style ours. 
            If you are in a pinch, you can use the spam can as a mold, just be sure to rinse it and line it with cling wrap so you can remove your sandwich from the mold.</p>
       
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>1 can Spam, cut into 8 slices approximately 3/8-inch thick</li>
                <li>1 teaspoon cooking oil</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon sugar</li>
                <li>sheets nori, cut in half lengthwise</li> 
                <li>3 cups cooked sushi rice</li>
                <li>Furikake seasoning, to taste</li>
            </ul>
        <h3>Steps to make</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Gather the ingredients.</li>
                <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Spray or oil the pan. When the pan is hot, add the spam and cook for about 2 minutes on each side, or until warmed and lightly browned.</li>
                <li>In a bowl, mix the soy sauce and sugar together, then pour over the spam in the hot skillet. Reduce the heat to medium and saut√© for 2 or 3 minutes, moving the spam around to coat it well with the soy and sugar. When the sauce has thickened and caramelized, remove the pan from heat.</li>
                <li>Place the sheet of nori on a plate and put the sushi mold over the nori in the center. Put a few spoonfuls of sushi rice inside the mold and use the press to compact the rice.</li>
                <li>Sprinkle the rice with some furikake.</li>
                <li>Place a slice of spam onto the seasoned rice.</li>
                <li>Spoon more sushi rice over the spam and press again.</li>
                <li>Holding the rice and spam in place with the press, remove the sushi mold, then gently remove the press. Wrap the nori around the spam and rice. Seal the package with a few grains of rice or a small amount of water, as if sealing an envelope. Repeat with the remaining ingredients.</li>
                <li>Serve immediately and enjoy.</li>
            </ol>
